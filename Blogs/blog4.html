        <h3>What does your picture look like? </h3>

        I did the ChatGPT prompt of <i> <b>"Based on what you know about me, draw a picture of what you think my current life looks like."  </b> </i>It's a popular prompt that has been going around, and supposedly women who put in the prompt are not getting many/any women in their pictures, while men are getting pictures with men in them.             

        <p> Mine actually turned out as a cozy yet tech-savvy workspace with a laptop displaying multiple screens. one showing Overleaf with a LaTeX document, another running Spark processes in Docker, and a cybersecurity alert dashboard open. Research papers, a notebook, and a cup of coffee are neatly arranged on the desk. The room has a personal touch, with family photos, a small jasmine flower symbol (hinting at an election campaign), and motivational quotes on the wall. The environment reflects a balance of intense focus and warmth, symbolizing resilience and ambition.</p>
