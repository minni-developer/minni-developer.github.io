        <h3>How I Explored Various Domains to Land in Cybersecurity</h3>
        <p>My journey to cybersecurity wasn’t linear—it was more of a winding path with plenty of exploration. As a software engineering student, I initially dabbled in different domains to see what sparked my interest. I began with web development, designing simple websites and learning JavaScript, but soon realized I craved more challenging puzzles to solve. I then delved into data science, working on big data analytics projects using Spark, which taught me a lot about handling and analyzing vast amounts of information.</p>

        <p>  Eventually, I stumbled upon reverse engineering while working on a university project. The thrill of dissecting software to understand its inner workings fascinated me, leading me to research mobile application vulnerabilities for my thesis. This sparked an interest in the security aspects of software development, particularly how to protect systems against threats. </p>
            
        <p> My curiosity led me to obtain certifications in ethical hacking and cybersecurity tools, participate in security testing exercises, and intern as a security analyst. I enjoyed the problem-solving nature of the field—each vulnerability felt like a puzzle waiting to be cracked. Now, as I work towards a career in cybersecurity, I feel grateful for the diverse experiences that helped me find my true passion. Exploring different domains taught me that cybersecurity isn't just about securing systems; it's about understanding how they work, and that’s what I love most.</p>
